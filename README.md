This is a repository to store use-case examples of earth engine code.

## How to use 

## How to contribute

### Contributing stand-alone scripts

1. Click Fork
2. Navigate to your fork and clone (can add git bash instructions here)
3. Open dev branch
4. Create a feature branch
5. Make changes
6. Make commit with descriptive message
7. Make a pull request (PR)

### Contributing Larger Inter-Connected examples
If you GEE workflows are embedded into larger projects (i.e R projects, markdowns documents) with more connected components it does not necessarily make sense to store the entire work flow here. Therefore, we recommend following the above steps, but at step 5: rather than adding files or folders just edit this readme document to include a link to your github repository.
